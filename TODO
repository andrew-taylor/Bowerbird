1) set up a framework for documentation of the system on
bioacoustics@cse.unsw.edu.au, and add to it when working on particular
bits.  It should be web accesisble.

Maybe doxygen+wiki?  There is an empty wiki
available here: http://bioacoustics.cse.unsw.edu.au/cgi-bin/twiki/view

2) Set up an appropriate git repository on bioacoustics@cse.unsw.edu.au

Just FYI Peter Gammie is doing some wiki/git development stuff on
bioacoustics.cse.unsw.edu.au which you might come across (its needs to
be kept separate - but that shouldn't be an issue)

And adding web stuff to bioacoustics.cse.unsw.edu.au might entail adding
a rewrite rule to the apache config at: /etc/apache2/conf.d/rewrite

3) See up a bug/issue tracking system, trac I guess on
bioacoustics@cse.unsw.edu.au

4) Move the "sound_capture" program into the same framework as programs
in the "s" directory.

5) Change the "sound_capture" program to do wavpack compression rather
than fork "/usr/bin/wavpack".  This can be done simple by calling
functions in s/util/sound_io.c (also see sound_io_test.c)

6) Change the "sound_capture" program to write sound directly to
/var/lib/bowerbird/data/<date/<time>.wv creating directories as necessary.

7) Add functionality (python to the web interface) so a naive user
can via web interface configure sound_capture to occur for specified
intervals per day.  e.g. daily 5:00-7:00 & 18:00-21:00

8) A very desirable feature is allow specification relative to
sunset/sunrise - e.g. capture sound for  an hour before dawn to an
hour after.  If the user specifies lat/long should be possible to infer
sunrise/sunset for a given date  to within 5/10 minutes.  "sound_capture"
has a special purpose code to this end for one location - but this won't
be useful.

9)The C programs in "s" read configuration parameters from a file named
bowerbird config s/util/parameter.c.  It may be appropriate to be changed
to work well with the (python) web interface.  It may be appropriate to
abandon the use of glibc here.

10) Integrate the processing code into the system be either to be
done in real-time with the sound-capture or later (MORE DETAIL NEEDED)

11) Add smart functionality for transfer of captured sound or other details.
(MORE DETAIL NEEDED)
