lcdd: (version 0.4ANSI) 12Jan2007

NAME:
        lcdd  -  Simple userspace daemon which acts as an ANSI driver for
                 HD44780 based char LCDs parallel connected to the
                 "LCD" port of the TS72x0 board.

SYNOPSIS:

        lcdd [-v] [-s LxCC] [named_pipe]

DESCRIPTION:

lcdd implements a simple userspace daemon that acts as a driver for
HD44780 character based LCD modules attached to a Technologics TS72x0
SBC via the "LCD" interface.

This version supports a subset of the ANSI terminal control sequences.

lcdd creates, opens and reads a named pipe (by default /dev/lcd),
initialises the lcd device, and sits a loop waiting for data on the
named pipe and writing it to the lcd device.

By default the size of the lcd is assumed to be 2 rows of 16 characters.
This can be changed by using the "-s" option.

Command line options & Flags:

 -v       verbose output, also prevents the program from detaching from 
          console and backgrounding. This is useful when debugging.
          the verbose output and any errors are output to stderr.

 -g LxCC  set the size of the lcd to L rows each of CC characters
          the default is 2x16

ANSI SUPPORT:

The following ANSI commands are supported:

   ESC D   Scroll Down
   ESC M   Scroll Up

   ESC [ n J  erase screen - n='0' erase to end of screen   (deafult)
                             n='1' erase to start of screen
			     n='2' erase all screen

   ESC [ n K  erase line   - n='0' erase to end of line     (deafult)
                             n='1' erase to start of line
			     n='2' erase all screen

   ESC [ X    underline cursor
   ESC [ Y    block cursor
   ESC [ Z    hide cursor

   ESC [ n A  cursor up    n times (default 1)
   ESC [ n B  cursor down  n times (default 1)
   ESC [ n C  cursor right n times (default 1)
   ESC [ n D  cursor left  n times (default 1)

   ESC [ r ; c H  cursor position at row r, column c
                  (counting from 1 up) default is 1;1 - top left

A non-standard Command is also supported:

   ESC [ n E  set shift and display entry mode 
              for n=4,5,6 or 7
	      This is sent as a direct lcd command to the lcd device
	      see HD44780 documentation.


BUGS:

Of course! This is beta s/w knocked together in my free time (precious
little). 

Not enough diagnostics.

Let me know if you use this software.  Any bugs, questions,
suggestions or problems, etc. should be sent to
