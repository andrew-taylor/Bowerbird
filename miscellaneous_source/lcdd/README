                                                        Version 0.4ANSI

lcdd - a user space driver for HD44780 based char. lcds 
       ANSI version - obeys a subset of ANSI terminal commands
       in so far as it can :-)  

Initial ANSI code from a patch set from Yan Seiner  <yan@seiner.com>

Software specific to Technologics TS72x0 ARM SBCs

see    

  http://www.embeddedx86.com/   
  
for board details.

The latest version of this program can be got from....

 http://www.comp.leeds.ac.uk/jj/linux/lcdd.tgz

It is provided under the terms of the GNU General Public License - see the
file COPYING for details.

Compiling
---------

Makefile is setup to use the Technologic Systems provided Cross compilation 
tool chain. See 
  
  http://embeddedx86.com/downloads/Linux/ARM/crosstool-linux.tar.bz2

Edit the Makefile for your setup.

compilation should be fairly simple just type "make".

Installation is a little complex in cross-compiling environments.
In the Makefile there is an install rule - ensure you edit the Makefile
to install in the correct place for your system, or simply copy the executable
"lcdd" to the right place.

The man page is not done. There is info on the program in the file
lcdd.txt which explains the command line options.

The ts72x0 specific routines are in the file ts7200io.c with header file
ts7200io.h (only a prototype at moment). These routines can be used in other
programs. At the moment you'll have to read the source files for more info.
Sorry.
